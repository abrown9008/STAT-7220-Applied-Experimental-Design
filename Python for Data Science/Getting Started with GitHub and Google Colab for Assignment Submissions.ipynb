    "## Part 2 – Creating a Branch for Each Assignment\n",
    "You will create **one branch per assignment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. On GitHub (your fork)**\n",
    "    - Go to your fork in GitHub.\n",
    "    - Click the **branch dropdown** (default is main).\n",
    "    - Type a new branch name like: `assignment-1`\n",
    "    - Click **Create branch: assignment-1 from main.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. In Google Colab**\n",
    "    - Open the notebook for the assignment from **your new branch, not main.**\n",
    "    - To do this:\n",
    "        - **File → Open Notebook → GitHub → Search for your repo → Select the branch you just created**.\n",
    "    - Work on your assignment normally in Colab.\n",
    "    - Save regularly (**File → Save a copy in GitHub**) — make sure to select your branch (`assignment-1`) in the dropdown when saving.\n",
    "    - When complete, save your final work to your **Google Drive** as well for backup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3 – Submitting Your Assignment\n",

    "1. **Finish your work in Colab** and save it to your branch (`assignment-1`) **and** to your Google Drive.\n",
    "2. From either your fork on GitHub or from Google Drive, download the final notebook file (`.ipynb`).\n",
    "3. Upload the notebook file to the appropriate D2L assignment submission area.\n",

    "- For Assignment 2:\n",
    "    1. Go to your fork’s `main` branch.\n",
    "    2. Pull any updates from the instructor’s repo (via **Sync Fork** in GitHub).\n",
